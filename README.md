# To-Do App

This is a simple movement App bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can preform basic movement functionality:

  - Take keyboard inputs, from the arrow keys
  - Move and object around the DOM
  - Record and visualize the movements to the user
  - Reset the object
  
This project was designed to illustrate an understanding of keyboard input, and how to record them.
